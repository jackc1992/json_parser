my interview went worse than I wanted to. There's no way I'd get this up in ~30 minutes (45 min interview, behavioural + general get to know you), and it was a company I was very keen to work for. I ended up just writing this after the fact... with no interview pressure it's annoyingly simple. This shall exist in public as a mark of shame.


It is roughly what I'd put out in a good case, ie. I wasted absolutely no time. My actual interview featured me forgetting about the Chars<_> iterator, and spending a good 5 minutes figuring out how to index into a string, before I had an unholy pattern match. I think I also had an n^2 lookup time for everything :) really excellent stuff.
